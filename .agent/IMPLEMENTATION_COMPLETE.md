## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**"The Consultant's Report"**
This layout mimics a professional consultancy report:
-   **Left Side**: "Here is the situation/risk." (Builds Authority & Need)
-   **Right Side**: "Here is the plan/solution." (Builds Trust & Action)

This structure is psychologically designed to lead the user from **Problem Awareness** to **Solution Adoption**.
